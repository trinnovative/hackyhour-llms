Amy takes 5 minutes for each slide.\n            2. After 2 slides (which takes 10 minutes), Amy takes a 2-minute break.\n            3. Amy has 50 minutes to take slides.\n            \n            We can group the time taken to slide 4 times and take a break as a single 'slide-block' which lasts for 22 minutes (20 minutes for sliding + 2 minutes for a break).\n            Now, we can find the number of complete slide-blocks Amy can have within the 50 minutes: \n            Number of slide-blocks is: 50//22=2\n            \n            Now, we calculate the total time taken for these 2 slide-blocks: \n            Total time for 2 slide-blocks is: 2x22=44 minutes\n            \n            Now, the remaining time Amy has is: 50-44=6 minutes\n            Number of slides in the remaining time is: 6//5=1\n            In the remaining 6 minutes, Amy can slide 1 more time as it takes 5 minutes to slide.\n            \n            Now, the total number of slides Amy can make is the sum of the slides during the slide-blocks and the additional slides in the remaining time:\n            Total slides = (2x4 slides per slide-block) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\n            So, Amy can slide 9 times in the 50 minutes.\n            "},
